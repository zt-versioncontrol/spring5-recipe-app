        "Guacamole! Did you know that over 2 billion pounds of avocados are consumed each year in the U.S.? (Google it.) " +
        "That's over 7 pounds per person. I'm guessing that most of those avocados go into what has become America's " +
        "favorite dip: guacamole.\n" +

        "The word \"guacamole\" and the dip, are both originally from Mexico, where avocados have been cultivated " +
        "for thousands of years. The name is derived from two Aztec Nahuatl words—ahuacatl (avocado) and molli (sauce)." +
        "All you really need to make guacamole is ripe avocados and salt. After that, a little lime or lemon juice—a " +
        "splash of acidity—will help balance the richness of the avocado. If you want, add chopped cilantro, chilis, " +
        "onion, and/or tomato\n." +

        "The trick to making perfect guacamole is using avocados that are just the right amount of ripeness. " +
        "Not ripe enough and the avocado will be hard and flavorless. Too ripe and the taste will be off.\n" +

        "Check for ripeness by gently pressing the outside of the avocado. If there is no give, the avocado is not " +
        "ripe yet. If there is a little give, the avocado is ripe. If there is a lot of give, the avocado may be too " +
        "ripe and not good. In this case, taste test first before using.\n" +

        "To slice open an avocado, cut it in half lengthwise with a sharp chef's knife and twist apart. One side will " +
        "have the pit. To remove it, you can carefully tap your chef’s knife against the pit and twist to dislodge " +
        "it (protecting your hand with a towel), or you can cut the avocado into quarters and remove the pit with " +
        "your fingers or a spoon.\n" +

        "Guacamole has a role in the kitchen beyond a party dip. It's great scooped on top of nachos and also " +
        "makes an excellent topping or side for enchiladas, tacos, grilled salmon, or oven-baked chicken.\n" +
        "Guacamole is great in foods, as well. Try mixing some into a tuna sandwich or your next batch of deviled eggs.\n";

    public static final String GUACAMOLE_DIRECTIONS =
        "Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Score the inside of the avocado " +
        "with a blunt knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Place in a bowl.\n" +

        "Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.)\n" +

        "Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice. The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance " +
        "to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown.\n" +

        "Add the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chilis. Chili peppers vary individually in their " +
        "spiciness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add more to the guacamole to your desired " +
        "degree of heat.\n" +

        "Remember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. " +
        "Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.\n" +

        "If making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down " +
        "to cover it to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn " +
        "the guacamole brown.)\n" +

        "Garnish with slices of red radish or jigama strips. Serve with your choice of store-bought " +
        "tortilla chips or make your own homemade tortilla chips.\n" +

        "Refrigerate leftover guacamole up to 3 days.";
